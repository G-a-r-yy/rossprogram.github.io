<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Application materials will be posted in January.</span></h2>

<h2>Application Deadline</h2>
<p>Starting March 1, the Admission Committee will begin accepting students on a rolling basis until all spaces have been filled.  The final deadline for 2018 Ross applications is <strong>April 1, 2018</strong>. However, spaces may  be filled early, so it is best to complete your application well before the end of March for adequate consideration.</p>
<h2>Applying to Ross/Asia</h2>
<p>Applications for Ross/USA and Ross/Asia are handled together: the same application may be used for either or both programs.</p>
<p><strong>Home-Stay Opportunity</strong><br />
We offer an optional cultural exchange program prior to the start of Ross/Asia.  Participants from outside China live with host families for a week in Nanjing, to learn more about modern Chinese culture. (This involves no additional cost to the student.)</p>
<p>Note: This home-stay program has no affiliation with Ohio State University and is neither promoted nor endorsed by Ohio State. All arrangements are handled directly by the company <em>Renascentia Hall International</em>.</p>
<h2>Financial Information</h2>
<p>The fee to attend the 2018 Ross Program in Ohio is $4000. (For <a href="http://www.rossmathasia.org/luosi2/index.php?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ross/Asia</a> the fee should be approximately 30,000 RMB.) The fees cover room, board, and instructional expenses.</p>
<p>The Ross Program endeavors to provide enough financial support to enable every accepted student to join us. If you have been accepted to the Ross Program and need financial assistance in order to attend, please ask your parent or guardian to contact us at <span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="mailto:ross@math.osu.edu">ross@math.osu.edu</a></span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. We will reply with details on how to apply for scholarship support.</span></p>
