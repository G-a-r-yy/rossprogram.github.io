## Working as a Ross Counselor

The Ross Program will hire counselors to work at the online program planed for 2021. 
Counselors supervise and advise the first-year students and junior counselors. 
Ross Counselors are expected to be available during the entire six weeks of the Program: 

&nbsp; &nbsp; June 27 through August 6, 2021.   

Application materials for the 2021 session will be posted **in January.** 
Look for updates at [please apply](to-apply/). <br>

## Application Requirements

A Ross Counselor needs a strong background in mathematics, and good social skills. 
We prefer applicants who are either math graduate students or undergraduate math majors 
who have completed at least two years of college. Applicants are expected to have completed a 
college course on Abstract Algebra, and to have some experience with elementary number theory.  
Prior knowledge of all the [Course Topics](/first-years/course-topics/) is not required.

Each counselor needs to pass a standard background check. Depending on your citizenship status, 
you might need to obtain an appropriate US visa to earn a salary at the Ross Program.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to 
race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnic origin, 
disability status, or protected veteran status.

## Counselor Responsibilities

Counselors are role models for the younger students. Counselors lead daily Zoom meetings 
with a group of 5 students, and evaluate (grade) the mathematical work they submit. 
Counselors provide gentle hints and advice to help inspire students to stay focused on their math problems. 
In addition, counselors participate in one or two math courses at more advanced levels (topics vary from year to year) 
and are encouraged to organize and present their own Zoom lectures on some topics of interest.

## Compensation

In exchange for six weeks of work, the Ross Foundation provides each counselor with 
a salary. We expect to offer a base salary of $3000 for six weeks of work, with 
opportunities to earn extra pay for additional duties as needed.
