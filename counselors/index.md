## Working as a Ross Counselor

The Ross Program will hire several counselors to work at Ross/USA from mid June to early August.  The Program will also hire several counselor to work at Ross/Aisa from early July to early August.  For those weeks, all Ross participants live in a college dormitory.  Counselors oversee dormitory life, and supervise and advise the first-year students and junior counselors. 

## Application Requirements

We are looking for students who are talented in mathematics and also have excellent social skills. We prefer applicants who are currently juniors or seniors in college, or who are graduate students working toward a degree involving math. Successful candidates should know basic abstract algebra and elementary number theory. Prior knowledge of all the [Course Topics](/first-years/course-topics/) is not required.

Each counselor must pass a background check prior to arrival on campus. If you are applying to Ross/USA and are not an American citizen or permanent resident, further steps might be needed for work authorization. Similarly, if you are applying to Ross/Asia and are not a Chinese citizen.  Let us know your citizenship when you apply and we will discuss possibilities.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability status, or protected veteran status.

## Counselor Responsibilities

Counselors are role models for the younger students. Counselors supervise dormitory life, evaluate (grade) the mathematical work submitted by their group of four students, and provide gentle hints and advice to help inspire students to stay focused on the number theory problems. In addition, counselors participate in one or two math courses (topics vary from year to year) and are encouraged to organize their own lectures or short courses in the dorm.

## Compensation

In exchange for six weeks of work, Ross/USA provides each counselor with room and board, and a salary.  No travel expenses are provided.  

Counselors at Ross/Asia work for five weeks with a smaller salary, but are reimbursed for travel expenses.
