Prof. Vitaly Bergelson led a course on Equidistribution 
during the 2020 Ross Program last summer.  He will continue that course
during this academic year.

NOTES from this course are posted at [NOTES](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwnwmsrzqjkm). 
Those have been updated to include the sessions during Autumn 2020.  

Notes for the lectures in the summer (a subset of those posted on Overleaf) are available at
[course notes on equidistribution](./Equidistribution_Notes.pdf).

Our first Autumn 2020 meeting was Tuesday, October 13

We will continue to meet every other Tuesday at **6:30 PM** Eastern Time.
