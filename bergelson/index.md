Prof. Vitaly Bergelson led a course on Equidistribution 
during the 2020 Ross Program last summer.  He will continue that course
during this academic year.

You may review the [course notes on equidistribution](./Equidistribution_Notes.pdf)
from the summer course.

Our first academic year meeting was Tuesday, October 13 
[in our Zoom room](https://zoom.us/my/rossmath?pwd=R2dSMG1ETDltRVNGT2tvT1hDcEg5dz09).
We will continue to meet every two weeks, on alternating Tuesdays,
at **6:30 PM** Eastern Time.  The next meeting will be November 10.
