Prof. Vitaly Bergelson led a course on Equidistribution 
during the 2020 Ross Program last summer.  He will continue that course
during this academic year.

Here are the notes from the summer course:
[course notes on equidistribution](./Equidistribution_Notes.pdf).
But those notes PLUS notes on the subsequent sessions in Autumn 2020
are available at [NOTES](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwnwmsrzqjkm).

Our first Autumn 2020 meeting was Tuesday, October 13 
[in our Zoom room](https://zoom.us/my/rossmath?pwd=R2dSMG1ETDltRVNGT2tvT1hDcEg5dz09).
We will continue to meet every two weeks, on alternating Tuesdays,
at **6:30 PM** Eastern Time.  The next meeting will be November 24.
