Prof. Vitaly Bergelson is continuing his course on Equidistribution that began last summer at
the 2020 Ross Program.  

NOTES from this course are posted on Overleaf at [NOTES](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwnwmsrzqjkm). 
Those notes have been updated to include most of the material discussed during Autumn 2020.  

Lecture notes for the summer course (a subset of the notes posted on Overleaf) are available at
[course notes on equidistribution](./Equidistribution_Notes.pdf). 

Meetings during the 2020-2021 meeting academic year will be 
[in our Zoom room](https://zoom.us/my/rossmath?pwd=R2dSMG1ETDltRVNGT2tvT1hDcEg5dz09).
We plan to meet every other Tuesday (pausing for holidays) at **6:30 PM** Eastern Time.  
Next meeting = February 2, 2021.
