Welcome to all participants who will join the 2019 Ross/USA
Mathematics Program.

# Travel

Participants are expected to arrive at our dormitory in Columbus before 5:00 PM on Sunday, June 23.  

- FLYING to the Columbus Airport (CMH):  A Ross staff member will 
be in the baggage claim area to meet participants as they arrive.  Shuttles
from the airport to the dorm will leave at various times
on Sunday (and on Saturday).  

If you are flying here from the Pacific coast, or from overseas, please plan
to arrive in Columbus on Saturday, June 22.  Then you will have some time to
recover from the trip before starting mathematical work on Sunday evening.

- DRIVING:  We will post driving directions on this website.

 -NOTE TO PARENTS.  You are welcome to travel with your son or daughter 
to the Ross Program, and to attend the Orientation Meeting at 7 PM on Sunday.
However, it is OK for your child to travel alone.  Ross staff members will
take over care and custody of your child when s/he arrives at the Columbus airport.
If s/he is young and taking long flights for the first time, you might
ask the airline about the option of traveling as an "unaccompanied minor".
