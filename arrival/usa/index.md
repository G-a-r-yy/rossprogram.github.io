# MEDICAL INFORMATION.  
There are two items to complete and return in two separate email messages:

   -  Download the [Medical Authorization](/materials/medical-authorization.pdf) 
   form, fill in the requested information, print the form on paper, have it 
   signed by your parent or guardian, and email it to us at [medical@rossprogram.org](mailto:medical@rossprogram.org) .<br>
That form asks for some of your health history, current 
medications, emergency contact information (parents phone numbers), 
and provides permission for doctors to treat you in case of injuries 
or illnesses during your time here.

   - Scan the front and back of your medical insurance card, 
   and email the resulting PDF file to  [medical@rossprogram.org](mailto:medical@rossprogram.org) ,
   with the subject line "insurance card"  followed by the name of the student.
   
   Ross participants must have health insurance that protects 
   them from major expenses due to medical emergencies.  
   Such events are very rare, but can happen.  Someone might 
   have an accident or illness that results in tens of thousands 
   of dollars of fees for hospitals and doctors. 

   The Ross Program's insurance requirement is fulfilled if 
   your current insurance policy covers "emergency medical care" 
   in Ohio, even if it does not cover routine care. Of course you 
   are welcome    to purchase additional insurance if desired.


<b>Do not already have insurance? </b> <br>
Many companies offer short term insurance policies that cover 
major medical expenses.  
Costs vary depending on the deductible, 
maximum coverage, and extras (like coverage during your travel).   
For example, see the various companies and policies listed at: 
&nbsp;   [Visitors Coverage](https://www.visitorscoverage.com/) .

Some Chinese participants purchased insurance policies 
valid in the USA through the 
<i>Ping An Property & Casualty Insurance Company of China</i>, 
or the <i>People’s Insurance Company of China</i>.

Please let us know if you are having difficulty arranging for such medical insurance.
