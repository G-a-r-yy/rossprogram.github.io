# Travel to Columbus

Participants are expected to arrive at our dormitory in Columbus<br>
<span style="color: red"><b>before 5:00 PM on Sunday, June 23</b></span>

When your travel plans have been made, complete the 
[Registration Form](https://forms.gle/Soia2isSWKmU9pVj9).  <br>
That online form asks for information about your arrival plans, 
as well as for contact information for you and your parents, 
in case of difficulties during travel.

- FLYING to the <i>John Glenn Airport (CMH)</i> in Columbus, Ohio:  
Ross staff members will
be in the baggage claim area to meet participants as they arrive.  <br>
If you are flying from the USA's Pacific coast or from overseas, please plan
to arrive in Columbus on Saturday, June 22.  Then you will have time to
recover from the trip before starting mathematical work on Sunday evening. <br>
Shuttles from the airport to the dorm will run as needed on that Saturday and Sunday. 

- DRIVING: Here are [Driving Directions](/materials/driving-directions.pdf) to 
Ohio Dominican University.

- NOTE TO PARENTS.  You are welcome to travel with your son or daughter 
to the Ross Program, and to attend the Orientation Meeting at 7 PM on Sunday.
However:  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; it is OK for your child to travel alone.  <br>
Ross staff members will take over care and custody of your child 
when s/he arrives at the Columbus airport.
If s/he is young and taking long flights for the first time, you might
ask the airline about the option of traveling as an "unaccompanied minor".

- DEPARTURE: The final lecture, awards presentations, and goodbyes will be
completed by 11:00 on Friday morning August 2.  Departing flights are 
best scheduled to leave on that Friday after 2 PM.  Shuttles 
will be scheduled so that participants gets to the airport more
than an hour before their flights.  <br>
If a Friday afternoon departure is inconvenient, you may schedule a 
Saturday flight.  Students may stay in the dorm on that Friday night,
but everyone needs to be away by early Saturday morning, August 3.
