Shuttles from the airport to the dorm will run as needed 
on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

Others in our dormitory are scheduled to move out on Friday.  
After the rooms are cleaned, they will be ready for Ross

and will be available on Friday evening.  <br>

## Employment Contract

Please download [the employment contract](/materials/employment-contract.pdf), 
fill in the dates that you will be arriving and departing, sign it, scan it, 
and upload it to
[our Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/F6TS8M14PkSG3MVUkKT1).

## Background check

Please download and complete [the background check authorization
document](/materials/background-check-authorization.pdf)
and then upload it to 
[our Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/F6TS8M14PkSG3MVUkKT1).

## Registration and Itinerary
When your travel plans have been made, complete the 
[Registration Form](https://forms.gle/Soia2isSWKmU9pVj9).  <br>
That online form is designed for campers rather than counselors, 
but please use it anyway.  It asks for information about your arrival plans, 
as well as for contact information for you and your parent 
(or other emergency contact person), in case of difficulties during travel.

## Agreements for Campers
Ross campers and junior counselors are asked to read
the documents [Program Rules](/materials/program-rules.pdf) 
and [Standards of Behavior](/materials/standards-of-behavior.pdf), and then
to sign the [Participation Agreement](/materials/participation-agreement.pdf). 
Counselors play a large role in ensuring that those Rules and Stndards are followed.
These issues will be discussed further during our initial counselor meeting.

### MEDICAL INFORMATION.  
There are two items to complete and return.

   -  Download the [Medical Authorization](/materials/medical-authorization.pdf) 
   form, fill in the requested information, print the form on paper, and sign where
   indicated.  If you are under 21 please have your parent (or guardian) sign it as well. 
   Then scan the signed document and email it to us at  <medical@rossprogram.org> .<br>
That form asks for some of your health history, current medications, and
emergency contact information (typically, parents' phone numbers).  
The point is to provide permission for doctors to treat you in case of injuries 
or illnesses during your time here.

   - Scan the front and back of your medical insurance card, 
   and email the resulting PDF file to  <medical@rossprogram.org> ,
   with the subject line "insurance card" followed by the name of the student.
   
Ross participants must have health insurance that protects 
them from major expenses due to medical emergencies.  
Such events are very rare, but can happen.  Someone might 
have an accident or illness that results in tens of thousands 
of dollars of fees for hospitals and doctors. 

The Ross Program's insurance requirement is fulfilled if 
your current insurance policy covers "emergency medical care" 
in Ohio, even if it does not cover routine care. Of course you 
are welcome to purchase additional insurance if desired.

<b>Do not already have insurance? </b> <br>
Many companies offer short term insurance policies that cover 
major medical expenses.  Costs vary depending on the deductible, 
maximum coverage, and extras (like coverage during your travel).
For example, see the various companies and policies listed at: 
&nbsp;   [Visitors Coverage](https://www.visitorscoverage.com/) .

Please let us know if you are having difficulty arranging for such medical insurance.
