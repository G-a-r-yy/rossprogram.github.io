participants who will join the 2019 Ross/Asia Mathematics Program.


________________________________________
### TRAVEL to Zhenjiang. <br>
All participants must arrive at our dormitory before 5 PM on Sunday
July 7. Those flying to China from other countries are advised to
arrive in Shanghai on Friday July 5, stay overnight in the airport
hotel, and take our chartered bus at 8 AM on Saturday morning.

The Ross/Asia  [Travel Plan](travel-plan.pdf) provides advice 
for traveling to the Jiangsu Aviation Technical College 
in Zhenjiang:

- Visa Information

Participants who are not Chinese citizens will need a valid passport 
from their home country, and a Chinese visa. Here are 3 documents 
providing instructions and advice on how to apply for an appropriate visa:

- [Visa application process](visa-application-process.pdf)
- [Instructions for visa application form](instructions-for-visa-application-form.pdf)
- [Visa application form](visa-application-form.pdf)

The visa application form section 2.6 asks for your "Itinerary in China." 
It's best to leave that blank and email your partially completed 
PDF form to Jerry Xiao [jxiao@renashall.com]. 
He will proofread your entries, insert the appropriate itinerary, and mail it back to you.

- Payment Options

Each participant's fee pays for room and board (college dorm room and cafeteria meals), 
and all instructional costs. Payment options are described in the Payment Instructions 
document below. The first page is for participants outside China, and the second
page is for those in China. The first installment is due by May 15.
