Welcome to all Counselors who will join the 2019 Ross/Asia Mathematics
Program.<br>
((NOTE. Some links mentioned below are not yet active))

### Travel to Zhenjiang.
The  [Counselor Travel Plan](counselor-travel-plan.pdf) 
contains advice on traveling to our dormitory at the 
Jiangsu Aviation Technical College in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.

Counselors need to arrive at our dorm before noon on Saturday July
6.    Those flying to China from other countries are advised to arrive
in Shanghai on Friday July 5, stay overnight in the airport hotel, and
take our chartered bus at 8 AM on Saturday morning.

### Visa Information

Participants who are not Chinese citizens will need a valid passport 
from their home country, and a Chinese visa. Here are 3 documents 
providing instructions and advice on how to apply for an appropriate visa:

- [Visa application process](https://rossprogram.org/arrival/asia/visa-application-process.pdf)
- [Instructions for visa application form](https://rossprogram.org/arrival/asia/instructions-for-visa-application-form.pdf)
- [Visa application form](https://rossprogram.org/arrival/asia/visa-application-form.pdf)

The visa application form section 2.6 asks for your "Itinerary in China." It's best to leave that blank and email your partially completed PDF form to Jerry Xiao  [jxiao@renashall.com].  He will proofread your entries, insert the appropriate itinerary, and mail it back to you.

### Registration and Itinerary
When your travel plans have been made, complete the <u>Registration Form</u> 
(link to be posted here). 
That online form asks about your arrival plans and 
emergency contacts, in case of difficulties during travel. 

### Employment Contract
Print the <u>employment contract</u> (to be posted here), fill in the
parts indicated, scan the signed document 
to make a PDF file, and email that file to <info@rossmathasia.org>.
  
At the first meeting (at noon on Saturday July 6), counselors will
complete some other empolyment documents.

### Background check
Please download the [background check authorization
document](/materials/background-check-authorization.pdf), fill it in, 
print it, sign it, scan the signed document, and upload the resulting
PDF to our secure 
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/F6TS8M14PkSG3MVUkKT1).
We will run a USA background check based on your name and SSN.  
If you do not have a US Social Security Number, enter zero in that box.

### Agreements for Campers
Ross campers and JCs are asked to read
<u>Program Rules</u>(/materials/program-rules-asia.pdf) 
and <u>Standards of Behavior</u>(/materials/standards-of-behavior-asia.pdf), 
and then to sign the <u>Participation Agreement 
</u>(/materials/participation-agreement.pdf). 
As a counselor, you do not need to sign that Agreement, 
and you may bring a laptop computer. 
But you should be familiar with the content of those three documents 
because counselors play a large role in ensuring that those Rules and Stndards 
are followed.<br>
These issues will be discussed further during counselor meetings.

### Medical Information.  
Download the <u>Medical Authorization 
</u>(/materials/medical-authorization-asia.pdf) 
form, fill in the requested information, print the form on paper, and sign where
indicated.  If you are under 21 please have your parent (or guardian) sign it as well. Then scan the signed document and email the resulting PDF to us at 
<info@rossmathasia.org> . <br>
That form asks for some of your health history, current medications, and
emergency contact information (typically, parents' phone numbers).  
The goal is to provide permission for doctors to treat you in case of injuries 
or illnesses during your time here.
