Having run the Ross Mathematics Program online in Summer 2020, we will continue to build the online Ross community with some outreach events during the academic year.  All these events will take place [in our Zoom room](https://zoom.us/my/rossmath?pwd=R2dSMG1ETDltRVNGT2tvT1hDcEg5dz09), and are open to the broader mathematical community, so please feel free to invite your friends.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Quaternions<span style="float:right; color:#888">Prof. Daniel Shapiro</span></h3>
<h4 style="margin:0; margin-bottom:12pt;">Thursday, October 08, 2020 at 7pm Eastern</h4>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px;">The plane is represented as ordered pairs (a, b) of real numbers.  By defining a multiplication operation on those pairs, we create the field 𝗖 of complex numbers.  That multiplication can be viewed geometrically, yielding rotations and dilations of the plane.  Many geometric problems can be recast as simpler statements within 𝗖.  In the 19th century, the complex numbers bacame a useful tool in studying problems of plane geometry.</p>

<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px;">In the 1840s, Hamilton hoped to find a similar algebraic structure underlying 3-dimensional space.  After many failed attempts, he realized that the “correct” algebra is 4-dimensional.  His system 𝗛 of quaternions has deep links with geometry in 3 and 4 dimensions.  During the past 175 years, that 4-dimensional algebra has provided major motivations for subsequent work in algebra and geometry.</p>

<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px;">In this lecture we will discuss Hamilton’s ideas.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Office hours, or Ask Me Anything<span style="float:right; color:#888">Prof. Tim All</span></h3>
<h4 style="margin:0; margin-bottom:12pt;">Wednesday, October 14, 2020 at 6pm Eastern</h4>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px;">Join me for some informal office hours. We can discuss Ross problem sets, mathematics I’ve been thinking about and/or teaching recently, or anything else; digressions, diversions, and distractions are very welcome! Hope to see you there.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Proofgramming<span style="float:right; color:#888">Prof. Jim Fowler</span></h3>
<h4 style="margin:0; margin-bottom:12pt;">Thursday, October 22, 2020 at 6pm Eastern</h4>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px;">People use computers to help with computations, but can computers also help us write proofs?  This talk is a friendly introduction to proof assistants, that is, to computer programs which help humans write proofs and verify their correctness.</p>

<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px;">The underlying machinery is “type theory” but rather than a survey, we’ll see some examples.  This is a “live” talk in the sense that we’ll see real examples running on a real computer, specifically using Agda.  By the end, you will perhaps believe that writing proofs and writing programs are not so different after all.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Games, Graphs, Groups, and Geometric Series<span style="float:right; color:#888">Prof. Rachel Skipper</span></h3>
<h4 style="margin:0; margin-bottom:12pt;">Tuesday, October 27, 2020 at 6pm Eastern</h4>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px;">In this talk, we will discuss the game “The Towers of Hanoi” which comes from a legend about monks who have divine orders to move 64 golden disks among three pegs. The legend says that when the monks have moved the last disk, the world will end and asks the question: when?  We’ll answer this question and see how the “Hanoi Tower group” connects the game to the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
