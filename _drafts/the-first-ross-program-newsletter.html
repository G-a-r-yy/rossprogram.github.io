<p>For decades, students have attended the Ross program and formed friendships over the summer.  A residential program is very effective at building community within a summer, but what about between summers?  With such a long-running program, there is a tremendous opportunity to build an inter-generational community of Ross alums.  With your help, those who attended the program at its inception will learn what is planned for next summer, and those who recently attended the program will partake of some of the wisdom of those who went before.  This electronic newsletter is a step towards building that inter-generatonal community.  If you are an alum or a parent or just interested in getting more young people involved in mathematics, then this newsletter is for you.</p>
<p>The <em>Ross Program Newsletter</em> will appear twice yearly, and will be posted on the Ross website and e-mailed to alums.  If you are not receiving a copy but would like to, please <a href="mailto:ross@math.ohio-state.edu">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>(This is where I'll add links to the various pages for this newsletter.)</p>
