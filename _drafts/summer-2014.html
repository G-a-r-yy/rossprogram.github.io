<p>Describe the current structure of the Ross Program:  number of students, JCs, and counselors.  Explain living arrangements in dormitory.</p>
<p>“Exciting things that have been happening behind the scenes.”  A phrase from the MathCamp newsletter.</p>
<p>Some photographs . . . classroom during lecture, students studying, the Garden of Constants, </p>
<p>Demographics:  The 40 first-year students come from many places, with many of them highly trained in excellent high school programs.  In the past decade the Ross participants have been approximately one-quarter female.  The proportion of foreign students has slowly been increasing, with 13 (?) of the forty coming from other countries in 2014, including 10 from China, and 1 each from the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>Outline current Number Theory course.  Evolution of the problem sets during early days when they were handwritten, and with major restructuring in 2000 (by Anna Medvedovsky and Noah Snyder?) and the changes coming with the conversion to a six-week format.  </p>
<p>Consequences of the cutback from 8 weeks to 6.<br />
One related point is with OSU’s new schedule the Spring semester ends before May 1 and Autumn classes start in mid-August.  This forces us to be out of the dorms before August so that we have to start in mid-June.  For instance, Ross students will arrive on Campus next summer on Sunday, June 14.  Unfortunately, this early start date makes it impossible for students in some school districts to participate.  This includes many New York students because required Regents Exams are typically given in late June.</p>
<p>Outline the recent advanced courses that have been offered, with some sample problems.</p>
