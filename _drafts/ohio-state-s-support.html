<p>Story about OSU’s funding:  On retirement in 1976 Arnold Ross convinced the provost to provide $45,000 annual rate to the Program as long as Ross himself was teaching.  I imagine that they were surprised that he continued to teach for 24 more years.  At that time, in 2000, we worked with associate provost Alayne Parson to institutionalize that funding, making it a permanent line item in the OSU budget.  A few years later the budget model of the university changed, making each unit responsible for its own funding.  At that time, the line item became part of the Department’s permanent budget.  This contribution from the University continues to be one of the three pillars of support for the Ross Program  (OSU, CMI, and Ross Memorial Fund).</p>
