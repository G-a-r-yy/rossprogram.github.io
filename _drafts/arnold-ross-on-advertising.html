<p>Arnold Ross was very hesitant to advertise the program publicly.  Information about the program was spread entirely by direct personal contact between prospective students and friends of the Program.  The reasons for this attitude:  he disliked the idea of rejecting interested students, and he was very hesitant to ask friends and colleagues for contributions.  We still run little direct advertising, but the reputation of the Ross Program is spread widely by comments on the internet in forums like AoPS, on the AMS high school outreach site, on some college websites (like those of MIT and Caltech), and by mentions in books (like books by Elizabeth Wissner-Gross).  That level of student awareness of the program, and the restriction to 40 first-year students, forces the admissions committee to reject many well-qualified applicants.  In the future with increasing numbers of highly trained applicants from China, I think we will need to insert a lottery system of some sort.<br />
   Does this mean that we should encourage people to create sister programs in China and India, and perhaps in the U.S. as well?  I think that funding is the limiting factor for such projects.</p>
