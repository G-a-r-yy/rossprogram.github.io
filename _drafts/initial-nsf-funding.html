<p>Include a FUNDING HISTORY section, describing initial NSF funding that lasted for many years, and extended by including a teacher program as a new feature.  This funding was built on Ross's personal influence with NSF program directors.  For some unfortunate reasons the NSF stopped all funding for high school outreach programs, as described in Allyn Jacksonâ€™s NAMS article (citation and link).</p>
