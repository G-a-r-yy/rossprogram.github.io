<p>In the late 1990s the Clay Math Institute was being created with Arthur Jaffe the president (a Harvard professor).  Their mission was to support mathematical research at the highest levels.  Brian Conrad brought up the pipeline question: Where will high-level researchers of the future come from?  He suggested funding top high school outreach programs like Ross and PROMYS.  Since then those programs have received substantial support through partnerships with CMI.</p>
