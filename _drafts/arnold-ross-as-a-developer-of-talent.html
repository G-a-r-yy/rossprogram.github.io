<p>Small point of attitude:  Arnold Ross was deeply interested in developing talent, finding youngsters with real mathematical talent then nurturing them and challenging them to rise to the highest levels.  Consequently he was mainly interested in the top ten to fifteen students with little apparent interest in helping those who were struggling or who were distracted by other things.  That policy changed after 2000, because of the changes in personnel as well as increases in the average mathematical levels of incoming Ross students.</p>
