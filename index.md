# Introduction

The Ross Program is an intensive summer experience designed to encourage motivated pre-college students to explore mathematics. During those six weeks, students are immersed in a world of mathematical discovery.

[Dr. Arnold Ross](/alumni/biography/ "Ross Biography") founded this multi-level program at Notre Dame University in 1957\. Its growth was then spurred by the launch of the Sputnik satellite and the subsequent surge of interest in science education. Arnold Ross’s Program has run every summer since then, moving to Ohio State in 1964\. The Ross Program no longer has a direct connection with the Ohio State University.  In 2019 the Program will be housed at Ohio Dominican University (http://www.ohiodominican.edu/).  Although housed at a Catholic university, the Ross Program has no connection with any religion.

The Ross Program's central goal has always been to instruct bright young students in the art of mathematical thinking and to inspire them to discover for themselves that abstract ideas are valuable and important. First year participants take the basic course in number theory. For most students, this is the first time they are asked to consider entirely new questions, to develop methods that they have not seen before, and to justify every answer.

The value of a mathematics education lies not only in obtaining proficiency in computational tasks, but also in building a foundation for critical thinking. Students who have never asked why things work the way they do are not prepared to lead the way to future scientific innovation. It is precisely this independence of thought and questioning attitude that the Ross Program strives to nurture.

**Ross Program in China.**  
_Ross/Asia_ will be held in China during July and August.  Dates will be announced later.  

Ross/Asia follows the same format and style as Ross/USA. All classes are held in English. This information is mentioned again on the Ross Program's _To Apply_ page, and will also be posted [HERE](http://www.rossmathasia.org/).  (You may select "English" in the navigation bar). We are grateful to the private company _Renascentia Hall International_ for their continuing support of Ross/Asia.

## Eligibility

![University Hall, with Math Tower behind, at Ohio State University]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/UHall-12ky344-300x217.gif){:style="float: right; margin-left: 12pt;"}

Ambitious pre-college students with interests in mathematics and science are invited to [apply](/students/to-apply/). First-year students range in age from 15 to 18 years old. (In rare cases, younger or older students are accepted.)  Admission decisions are based on several criteria, including: school transcripts; teacher recommendations;  essays concerning the applicant’s interests and goals; and the applicant’s work on some challenging math problems.  
Undergraduate math majors, and math graduate students, are invited to [apply to be a Ross Counselor](/counselors/).

NOTE. The Ross Program cannot accommodate students who must arrive in Columbus more than two days after the start of classes. Unfortunately, this policy eliminates applicants whose high schools have exams in late June.

## Costs and Financial Aid

Fees for this program are determined the cost of six weeks of room and board and by various instructional costs. The Program fee for 2018 will be $5000.  However: 
[Financial aid](/students/faq "Frequently Asked Questions") is available and we encourage qualified students to apply. We hope to be able to provide enough support to enable every accepted applicant to attend this great Program.

## To Apply

_The Ross Program application will be posted in January.  The Admissions Committee will start reading applications on March 1, starting a process of rolling admissions a week or two after that.  The final application deadline is April 1, but spaces do fill up quickly so it’s best to apply early.

## Ross Program Support

The Ross Program is supported in several ways. Partners in this mathematical enterprise include:

[![American Mathematical Society]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/AMS_logo-14vyxtl.jpg)](http://www.ams.org/programs/edu-support/epsilon/emp-epsilon) [![Jane Street]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/JaneStreetLogoS-204ezrg.gif)](https://www.janestreet.com/) [![Elsevier]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Elsevierlogo150-20pw3bu.jpg)](http://www.elsevier.com/) and several private donors.

## Related Programs

Several other excellent summer mathematics programs are listed on the AMS [mathcamps](http://www.ams.org/programs/students/high-school/emp-mathcamps) webpage. Two of them, [PROMYS](http://www.promys.org) at Boston University, and the [Honors Summer Math Camp](http://www.txstate.edu/mathworks/camps/hsmc.html) at Texas State University, are very close in spirit to the Ross Program since they are run by Ross alumni.
