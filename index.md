# Introduction

The Ross Program is an intensive summer experience designed to encourage motivated pre-college students to explore mathematics. During those weeks, students are immersed in a world of mathematical discovery.

[Dr. Arnold Ross](/alumni/biography/ "Ross Biography") founded this multi-level program at Notre Dame University in 1957\. Its growth was then spurred by the launch of the Sputnik satellite and the subsequent surge of interest in science education. Arnold Ross’s Program has run every summer since then, associated with Ohio State University from 1964 through 2018. In 2019 the Program will be located at <a href="http://www.ohiodominican.edu/"> Ohio Dominican University</a>.  

Our central goal has always been to instruct bright young students in the art of mathematical thinking and to inspire them to discover for themselves that abstract ideas are valuable and important. First year participants take the basic course in number theory. For most students, this is the first time they are asked to consider entirely new questions, to develop methods that they have not seen before, and to justify every answer.

The value of a mathematics education lies not only in obtaining proficiency in computational tasks, but also in building a foundation for critical thinking. Students who have never asked why things work the way they do are not prepared to lead the way to future scientific innovation. It is precisely this independence of thought and questioning attitude that the Ross Program strives to nurture.

**Ross Program in China.**  
The 2019 _Ross/Asia_ program will be a five-week session held on a college campus in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.  

Ross/Asia follows the same format and style as Ross/USA. All classes are held in English. Further information appears on the Ross Program's [Application](/students/to-apply/) page, and will also at the [Ross/Asia website](http://www.rossmathasia.org/).  (You may select "English" in the navigation bar). We are grateful to the private company _Renascentia Hall International_ for their continuing support of Ross/Asia.

## Eligibility

Ambitious pre-college students with interests in mathematics and science are invited to [apply](/students/to-apply/). First-year students range in age from 15 to 18 years old. (In rare cases, younger or older students are accepted.)  Admission decisions are based on several criteria, including: school transcripts; teacher recommendations;  essays concerning the applicant’s interests and goals; and the applicant’s work on some challenging math problems.  
Undergraduate math majors and math graduate students are invited to [apply to be a Ross Counselor](/counselors/).

NOTE. The Ross Program cannot accommodate students who must arrive more than two days after the start of classes.

## Costs and Financial Aid

Fees for this program are determined by the cost of five or six weeks of room and board and by various instructional costs. The Ross/USA fee for 2019 will be $5000. The fee for Ross/Asia will be 35,000 RMB. 

NOTE: [Financial aid](https://rossprogram.org/students/faq/#are-scholarships-available) is available. Accepted applicants are encouraged to apply if their families have financial need. We hope to be able to provide enough support to enable every accepted applicant to attend this great Program.   

## To Apply

The Ross Program application will be posted in January. In March, The Admissions Committee will start the admissions process.  The final application deadline is April 1. <br>
HOWEVER: Spaces fill up quickly so it’s best to apply well before that deadline.

The Ross Program admits students of any race, color, and national or ethnic origin.

## Related Programs

Several other excellent summer mathematics programs are listed on the AMS 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/students/high-school/emp-mathcamps" target="_blank">mathcamps</a> webpage. 
Two of them, [PROMYS](http://www.promys.org) at Boston University, and the [Honors Summer Math Camp](https://www.txstate.edu/mathworks/camps/Summer-Math-Camps-Information/hsmc.html) at Texas State University, are very close in spirit to the Ross Program since they are run by Ross alumni.
