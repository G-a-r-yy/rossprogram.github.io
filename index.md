Ross at Ohio Dominican:  Sunday June 21   through   Friday July 31, 2020.  <br>
Ross at Rose-Hulman: Sunday June 28  through  Friday August 7, 2020.

### CANCELLATION
We have canceled the 2020 Ross/Asia program planned to be in China.  
Difficulties surrounding the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak 
have forced us to make this cancellation. 

Instead there will be two six-week sessions of the Ross Mathematics Program.  One at 
Ohio Dominican University in Columbus Ohio, and the other at 
Rose Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana.  The two sessions 
will be very similar in style and content.  The major difference
is in the dates of operation.
NOTE.  Applicants who chose "Ross/Asia" will automatically be considered for one of 
the Ross sites in the USA.  

# Introduction

The Ross Program is an intensive summer experience designed to encourage 
motivated pre-college students to explore mathematics. During those weeks, students are immersed in a world of mathematical discovery.

[Dr. Arnold Ross](/alumni/biography/ "Ross Biography") founded this 
multi-level program at Notre Dame University in 1957\. Its growth was 
then spurred by the launch of the Sputnik satellite and the subsequent 
surge of interest in science education. Arnold Ross’s Program has run 
every summer since then, associated mostly with Ohio State University 
from 1964 through 2018. In 2019 the Program moved to 
<a href="http://www.ohiodominican.edu/"> Ohio Dominican University</a>.  

Our central goal has always been to instruct bright young students in the art of mathematical thinking and to inspire them to discover for themselves that abstract ideas are valuable and important. First year participants take the basic course in number theory. For most students, this is the first time they are asked to consider entirely new questions, to develop methods that they have not seen before, and to justify every answer.

The value of a mathematics education lies not only in obtaining proficiency in computational tasks, but also in building a foundation for critical thinking. Students who have never asked why things work the way they do are not prepared to lead the way to future scientific innovation. It is precisely this independence of thought and questioning attitude that the Ross Program strives to nurture.

**Ross Program in China.**  
We are disappointed that the 2020 _Ross/Asia_ program might be cancelled.  
We are working to find a location within the USA to replace Ross/Asia.  



## Eligibility

![Erskine Hall at Ohio Dominican](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Ohio_Dominican_University_%28Columbus%2C_Ohio%29_-_Erskine_Hall.jpg/1920px-Ohio_Dominican_University_%28Columbus%2C_Ohio%29_-_Erskine_Hall.jpg){:style="float: right; margin-left: 12pt; width: 50%;"}

Ambitious pre-college students with interests in mathematics and science are invited 
to [apply](/students/to-apply.md/). First-year students range in age from 15 to 18 years old. 
(In rare cases, younger or older students are accepted.)  Admission decisions are based 
on several criteria, including: school transcripts; teacher recommendations;  
essays concerning the applicant’s interests and goals; and the applicant’s 
work on some challenging math problems. 
Undergraduate math majors and math graduate students are invited 
to [apply to be a Ross Counselor](/counselors/).

NOTE. The Ross Program cannot accommodate students who must arrive more than two days after the start of classes.

## Costs and Financial Aid

Fees for this program are determined by the cost of five or six weeks of room and board 
and by various instructional costs. The Program Fee for 2020 will be $5000. 


NOTE: [Financial aid](https://rossprogram.org/students/faq/#are-scholarships-available) 
is available. Accepted applicants are encouraged to apply if their families have some 
financial need. We hope to be able to provide enough support to enable every 
accepted applicant to attend this great Program.   

## To Apply

Each January, the Ross Program application is posted on the [to apply](/students/to-apply.md/) page. 
In March, The Ross Admissions Committee starts the admissions process.  
The final application deadline is April 1. <br>
HOWEVER: Spaces fill up quickly so it’s best to apply well before that deadline.

The Ross Program admits students of any race, color, and national or ethnic origin.

## Ross Program Support

The Ross Program is supported in several ways. Partners in this mathematical enterprise include:

[![American Mathematical Society]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/AMS_logo-14vyxtl.jpg)](http://www.ams.org/programs/edu-support/epsilon/emp-epsilon)

## Related Programs

Several other excellent summer mathematics programs are listed on the AMS 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/students/high-school/emp-mathcamps" target="_blank">mathcamps</a> 
webpage. Two of them, [PROMYS](http://www.promys.org) at Boston University, and the 
[Honors Summer Math Camp](https://www.txstate.edu/mathworks/camps/Summer-Math-Camps-Information/hsmc.html) 
at Texas State University, are very close in spirit to the Ross Program since they are run by Ross alumni.
