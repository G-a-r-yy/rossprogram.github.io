<h1>News from Former Ross Participants</h1>
<p>Listed mostly in chronological order of the person's first year of attendance at the Program.</p>

After attending the Ross Program at Notre Dame in the summer of 1961 (after my sophomore year in high school), I attended another NSF SSTP at Oregon State the following year. In that program we did a wider variety of topics than in the Ross program, including Fortran programming and switching theory. I got hooked on computers then and made them my life's work. I got an undergraduate degree in mathematics from the Illinois Institute of Technology (1967) and a doctorate in computer science from Cornell University (1971). I was a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1970-2000, retiring as a Professor Emeritus of Computer Science in December 2000 and moved to the Department of Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology as professor and chair, an administrative post I held until 2006.My research interests are in theoretical computer science--especially the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. I was made a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1995, I have authored or coauthored more than 70 research papers and 10 books; my papers on backtrack search, generation of combinations, weight-balanced binary trees, and drawing of trees and graphs are now considered classics. In the early 1980s I devised and implemented the calendar/diary part of GNU Emacs, maintaining it for many years. That work led to an intense interest in calendars and their computer implementation, resulting several scholarly papers and books.I live in Skokie, Illinois with my wife Ruth (nee Nothmann) of over 40 years. We have four daughters (all on the East Coast) and nine grandchildren.</p>

I would be glad to hear from anyone associated with the Ross Program. It was a real blockbuster in my life.</p>
<p>Lots has happened since the last update, of course.</p>
<p>My main job is currently designing cell phone software for Nokia. I did get a patent issued in internet security since the last update and that was definitely related to some of the mathematics I did with the program long ago! I also have two patents in the process for some biomedical work and another two (which I'm more excited about) in music technology and games. (All of those are a bit "mathy", too.)</p>
<p>The main thing I'd like to do right now is to successfully launch a music video game that's lots of fun but also teaches some real music performance and listening skills. I have prototypes working on the PC and XBox with some other popular platforms close behind in development. I haven't lined up the right funding and marketing resources yet, though I have some candidates.</p>
<p>I'm also volunteer teaching in elementary school K-5 in computer technology, particularly <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Lifelong Kindergarten Scratch</a>, and will be speaking at the MIT Media Lab Scratch Conference 2010. If you haven't tried Scratch, it is free and so much fun for everyone, young people (8 to 18) in particular. I find Scratch in some ways like the Ross program in that it enables young people in math (and other areas), encouraging them to achieve and reach beyond their wildest dreams. Like mathematics, computer technology (particularly the graphical SmallTalk related technology of Scratch) is accessible and powerful without requiring years of previous study. In Scratch, our cycle is imagine...create...share...imagine... . I don't find that so much different from the attitude of the Ross program.</p>
<p>I live in the Boston area.</p>
