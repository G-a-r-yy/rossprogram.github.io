<p>We feel that the Ross Program can take some credit for successes of alumni. Listed below are some alumni accomplishments and recognitions that have happened in the past few years. Please write to <a href="mailto:rossmath.osu.edu">rossmath.osu.edu</a> so we can expand this list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glen Whitney (Ross 1983, 1984, 1986)</strong> as instrumental in founding the <a href="http://momath.org/">Museum of Mathematics</a>. That Manhattan-based museum strives to enhance public perception of mathematics with dynamic exhibits and programs that stimulate inquiry, spark curiosity, and reveal the wonders of mathematics. Many articles have appeared about MoMath. One from 2011, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/science/28math.html">One Math Museum, Many Variables</a>, mentions the Ross Program.</li>
<li><strong>Jacob Lurie (Ross 1993, 1997, 1998)</strong> is a Harvard professor of mathematics working in higher category theory and derived algebraic geometry. He received a 2014 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Prize_in_Mathematics">Breakthrough Prize</a>. In September 2014, he was also named a <a href="http://www.macfound.org/fellows/class/class-2014">MacArthur Fellow</a> (referred to as a "genius grant"). We feel deeply honored that Professor Lurie recently made a significant donation to the <a href="/rossmath/contribute/">Ross Endowment Fund</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Charles Safran (Ross 1967) </strong>was presented the 2014 <a href="http://www.amia.org/news-and-publications/press-release/charles-safran-md-wins-morris-f-collen-award-excellence-amia-201">Collen Award</a>, the most prestigious national award in medical informatics.</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Shapiro (Ross 1966, 1970)</strong> received the <a href="http://www.osu.edu/universityawards/2014/dsa.html">Ohio State University's Distinguished Service Award</a> in 2014, primarily for his work with the Ross Mathematics Program.</li>
<li><strong>Robert Coleman (Ross 1971)</strong> was named a 1987 MacArthur Fellow ("genius grant").</li>
<li><strong>David Harbater (Ross 1969, 1973)</strong> was awarded the 1995 Cole Prize in Algebra.</li>
<li><strong>Karl Rubin (Ross 1972, 1975)</strong> was awarded the 1992 Cole Prize in Number Theory.</li>
</ul>
