<h3>What is an interesting mathematical problem you have worked on?</h3>
<p>Recall a problem that you spent some time thinking about. Carefully state the problem. Describe the work you have done on it.</p>
<h3>Describe in detail your mathematical experiences beyond standard schoolwork.</h3>
<p>Have you worked on some interesting mathematical projects? If so, what were the topics? For the project you enjoyed the most: How much time did you spend on it? Were you working alone, guided by a mentor, or as part of a team? What benefits do you feel you gained from doing that work?</p>
<p>Have you entered any math competitions? Which ones? Did you do well on them?<br />
How do your math contest experiences (both preparing for and participating in contests), compare with math courses you have taken in high school or in other venues?</p>
<p>Have you participated in math programs outside of school?<br />
These could be residential programs (like Ross), a local Math Club with after-school meetings, a Math Circle at some nearby college, etc.<br />
What sorts of activities were involved? Did those sessions inspire you to work on mathematical ideas outside of the formal meetings? Did you enjoy those experiences?</p>
<h3>What books have you read about mathematical topics?</h3>
<p>Which were your favorites? What parts of them were most enjoyable or interesting to you?</p>
<h3>How do you like to spend your time?</h3>
<p>What are your interests and hobbies? What do you like to do to relax?</p>
<h3>Are you eager to spend five or six weeks away from home, with no distractions from computers or video games, focusing all of your energies on one narrow area of mathematics?</h3>
<p>Our students live in a college dormitory, with no access to televisions, computers, or electronic games. Most of their waking hours are spent working on challenging math problems. Does this intensity and focus appeal to you?</p>
<h3>What do you plan to major in at college? What are your career goals?</h3>
<p>Do you feel “driven” toward one type of work? Or will you take a variety of courses in college and see what areas seem most interesting?</p>
<h3>Is English your native language?</h3>
<p>Indicate “yes” or “no."</p>

<h3>The following section is to be completed by non-native English speakers.</h3>
<p>Applicants who are not native English speakers are asked to provide evidence of proficiency in English. This can be done by submitting a PDF copy of an official score report for one of the standardized tests listed below. (You may use the upload button on this page of the Ross application, or email it to us.)<br />
Here are the minimum expected scores:</p>
<p>TOEFL iBT: Combined score of at least 80, and 22 or higher on the speaking section.<br />
IELTS: Combined score of at least 6.5, and 7.0 or higher on the speaking section.<br />
iTEP: Combined score of at least 4.5, and 5.0 or higher on the speaking section.</p>
<p>Note: There are other ways to show your English proficiency and we can discuss those if needed. Some applicants might participate in a Skype conversation as part of their application.</p>
<h3>What type of training or experience do you have with spoken and written English?</h3>
