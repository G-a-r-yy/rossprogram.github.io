<h2>Working as a Ross Counselor</h2>
<p>The Ross Program will hire several counselors to work from mid June to late July. For those six weeks, counselors live in a campus dormitory and supervise/assist the first-year students.<br />
<strong>   **Apply to be a Counselor in the 2017 session.**<br />
</strong> Contact us in January to start the application process.</p>
<h2>Application Requirements</h2>
<p>We are looking for students who are talented in mathematics and also have excellent social skills. We prefer applicants who are currently juniors or seniors in college, or who are graduate students working toward a degree involving math. Successful candidates should know basic abstract algebra and elementary number theory. (Prior knowledge of all items on the <a href="http://u.osu.edu/rossmath/course-topics/" target="_blank">Course Topics</a> page is not required.)</p>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a Ross Counselor, please contact us at <a href="mailto:ross@math.osu.edu" target="_blank">ross@math.osu.edu</a>. The reply email will contain an application to complete and return.</p>
<p>Each counselor must pass a background check prior to arrival on campus. If you are applying to Ross/USA and are not an American citizen or permanent resident, further steps might be needed for work authorization. Similarly, if you are applying to Ross/Asia and are not a Chinese citizen.  Let us know your citizenship when you apply and we will discuss possibilities.</p>
<p>All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability status, or protected veteran status.</p>
<h2>Counselor Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Counselors are role models for the younger students. Counselors supervise dormitory life, evaluate (grade) the mathematical work submitted by their group of four students, and provide gentle hints and advice to help inspire students to stay focused on the number theory problems. In addition, counselors participate in two math courses (topics vary from year to year) and are encouraged to organize their own lectures or short courses in the dorm.</p>
<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>In exchange for six weeks of work, the Ross Program provides each counselor with room and board and a stipend of $3500.  (Counselors at Ross/Asia have a different pay scale.)</p>
