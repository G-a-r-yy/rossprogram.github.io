<p>Running the Ross Mathematics Program is expensive.</p>
<p>For many years, major funding for the Ross Program was provided by the National Science Foundation and later the Clay Math Institute.  Since 2015 we have received no major funding from outside OSU. Most of the Program’s support  now comes from the University, increased student fees, and interest from the Ross Endowment Fund. Please consider joining our effort to build the <em>Ross Endowment Fund</em>. With your support the Program will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>A wonderful start was made by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lurie">Jacob Lurie</a>’s gift of $100,000. Lurie was a student in the Ross Program in 1993, and is currently a Harvard math professor, recognized for his world-class mathematical research with both a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Prize_in_Mathematics">Breakthrough Prize</a> and a <a href="http://www.macfound.org/fellows/class/class-2014/">MacArthur Fellowship</a>.</p>
<p>We ask you to follow Jacob Lurie’s lead by helping to build this Endowment Fund. Your contribution is important, and will be greatly appreciated. This fund is administered by the Ohio State University Foundation, having a 501(c)(3) non-profit tax-exempt status with federal tax ID number of 31-1145986.</p>

<h3>Corporate matching gifts</h3>
<p>Many companies have giving plans that match their employees’ charitable contributions. Your employer’s Human Resources department can tell you whether such plans are in place.</p>
<h3>Alternative forms of support</h3>
<p>We can work with you to accommodate contributions of various kinds, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or publicly traded securities. Many donors prefer to contribute appreciated securities in order to take advantage of federal income tax deductions. A tax accountant or financial planner can provide advice on which options are best for you. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:ross@math.osu.edu">ross@math.osu.edu</a> to discuss possibilities.</p>
<h3>Private and corporate donors</h3>
<p>Do you know of a foundation or corporation that might support the educational mission of the Ross Program? If so, please <a href="mailto:ross@math.osu.edu">send us</a> your suggestions.</p>
<h2>Thank you</h2>
