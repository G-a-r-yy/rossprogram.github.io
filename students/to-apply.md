# Instructions

Application materials were posted on January 4, 2021.   
Students may initiate the Ross application process by visiting 
<a href="https://apply.rossprogram.org/">https://apply.rossprogram.org/</a>,
creating a Ross account, and completing the forms posted there. The application 
asks for demographic information, school transcripts, letter of recommendation, 
responses to several essay prompts, and uploaded solutions 
to some mathematical problems.  

Common technical problem:  The system says: &nbsp; **User not found.**  <br>
That usually means that the session cookie has expired.  
The solution: Logout from the Ross system (click on your own email address at the upper-right), then login again.

Applicants who have technical troubles or other questions about the 
application process are welcome to email 
<a href="mailto:ross@rossprogram.org">ross@rossprogram.org</a>.

## Application Deadline

The Ross Admissions Committee will begin reading the applications in 
March and will start making acceptance decisions in April.  
The final deadline for Ross applications is **April 1**. 
Applications will be read and decisions made mostly in chronological order, 
so it is best to complete your application well before the end
of March for adequate consideration.
