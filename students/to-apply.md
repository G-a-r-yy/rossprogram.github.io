# Instructions

## The APPLICATION WINDOW will open in January.

When the application window is open, students may initiate the 
Ross application process by visiting 
<a href="https://apply.rossprogram.org/">https://apply.rossprogram.org/</a>,
creating a Ross account, and completing the forms posted there. The application 
asks for demographic information, school transcripts, letter of recommendation, 
responses to several essay prompts, and uploaded solutions 
to several mathematical problems.  

Applicants who have technical troubles or other questions about the 
application process are welcome to email 
<a href="mailto:ross@rossprogram.org">ross@rossprogram.org</a>.

## Application Deadline

Starting March 1, the Ross Admissions Committee will begin accepting
students until all spaces have been filled.  The final deadline for
Ross applications is **April 1**. However, spaces might be filled
early, so it is best to complete your application well before the end
of March for adequate consideration.
  

## Financial Information

The fee to attend the online Ross Program in 2021 is $1500. That fee covers 
all instructional expenses. 

## Scholarships

The Ross Program endeavors to provide enough financial support to
enable every accepted student to attend. If you have been accepted to
the Ross Program and need financial assistance in order to join us,
please ask your parent or guardian to contact us at
[ross@rossprogram.org](mailto: ross@rossprogram.org). We will reply
with details on how to apply for scholarship support.

## Commitment to Nondiscrimination

The Ross Program does not discriminate on the basis of gender, gender
identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, creed, color,
ethnic origin, disability, or marital status in its admissions,
educational programming, financial aid, employment practices, or other
activities.
