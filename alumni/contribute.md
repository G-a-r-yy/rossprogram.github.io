Running the Ross Mathematics Program is expensive.

For many years, major funding for the Ross Program was provided by the National Science Foundation and later by the Clay Math Institute.  Since 2015 we received no major funding from outside OSU, and in 2018 the Ross Program separated from Ohio State University. Ross funds are now processed by the new <i>Ross Mathematics Foundation</i>. Most of the Program’s support will come from student fees, gifts from generous donors, and income from the Program's Endowment Funds. Please consider joining our effort to build the _Ross Endowment Funds_. <br>
With your support the Program will continue to thrive.

A wonderful start was made by the [Jacob Lurie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lurie)’s gift of $100,000\. Lurie was a student in the Ross Program in 1993, and is currently a Harvard math professor, recognized for his world-class mathematical research with both a [Breakthrough Prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Prize_in_Mathematics) and a [MacArthur Fellowship](http://www.macfound.org/fellows/class/class-2014/).

We ask you to follow Jacob Lurie’s lead by helping to build our Endowment Fund. It is administered by the Ohio State University Foundation, having a 501(c)(3) non-profit tax-exempt status with federal tax ID number of 31-1145986. Your contribution is important, and will be greatly appreciated. 

We will create a new endowment fund, administered by the Ross Mathematics Foundation.  Since that Foundation does not yet have federal tax-exempt status, the other OSU Endowment Fund might be more attractive for Ross donors. 

## How to Contribute

### By check

Please make out the check to “the Ohio State University Foundation” with “Ross Endowment Fund” in the memo, and mail it to:

Ross Mathematics Program<br>
Department of Mathematics - OSU<br>
231 West 18th Avenue<br>
Columbus, OH 43210

### Online

Credit card contributions can be made via Ohio State Giving at https://www.giveto.osu.edu/makeagift. Search for the “Ross Mathematics Program Endowment Fund” (fund number 646206) and follow the directions on how to make a gift.  

For either method of contributing, please [send us a short email](mailto:ross@math.osu.edu) to make sure that we know about your donation. You should receive a emailed tax receipt from the OSU Foundation.

### Corporate matching gifts

Many companies have giving plans that match their employees’ charitable contributions. Your employer’s Human Resources department can tell you whether such plans are in place.

### Alternative forms of support

We can work with you to accommodate contributions of various kinds, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or publicly traded securities. Many donors prefer to contribute appreciated securities in order to take advantage of federal income tax deductions. A tax accountant or financial planner can provide advice on which options are best for you. Please contact us at [ross@math.osu.edu](mailto:ross@math.osu.edu) to discuss possibilities.

### Private and corporate donors

Do you know of a foundation or corporation that might support the educational mission of the Ross Program? If so, please [send us](mailto:ross@math.osu.edu) your suggestions.
